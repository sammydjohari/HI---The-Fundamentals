### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

6 weeks

### :dart: Goals:

I went with a personal recipe bank and set the following goals:
- Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Build a responsive site across any device
- Build something I enjoy and can use
- Explore JS as much as possible
- Build a snakegame
- Get the basics of Git and using github

### :grimacing: The process:

This being the first project, I had a tough start deciding what to create, how to do it and actually learning from it. I had basically no prior experience in coding so I had a long road ahead of me. I decided to implement what we learned in class to the the mainpages and to create the snakegame for fun. I mostly freestyled for the mainpages and did my best, but for the snakegame I followed a tutorial and personlized it, to then sit down and really trying to understand the code that I'd written.
